-- *** Basic Functions ***

-- write a function, multThree, that multiplies 3 numbers together EX:
-- EX: mult 2 2 3      =>      12


-- write a function, concat, that combines two string together
-- concat "Josh" "Sam"   =>    "JoshSam"


-- write a function, lessGreater, that takes in a number and returns "LESS" if
--   the number is < 100 and returns "GREATER_EQUAL" if <= 100
-- EX: lessGreater 10    =>     Less







-- ** LISTS **

-- Assuming that a list is greater then length 3 return the second element in the list
-- EX: getSecond [1,2,3,4]   => 2



-- Assuming that a list is greater then length 3, write a function that takes in 2 lists
--   and returns true if the first elements of both lists match. If they do not return
--   False



-- Given a list if length then return the first 4 elements (hint: there is a built in
--   function for this...)


-- Create a list from 1 - 10 with as little code as possible







-- ** List Comprehensions **

-- Return the first ten numbers (1-10) squared.
-- EX: [1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100]


-- return the numbers between 1 - 10 where a number mod 2 = 0
-- EX: [2,4,6,8,10]


-- create a function, getEven, that takes in a number (x) and returns the first x number 
--  of even numbers. 
-- EX: getEven 5   => [2,4,6,8,10]
--     getEven 10  => [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18, 20]
-- ** Hint we need to use lazy initialization!!!
